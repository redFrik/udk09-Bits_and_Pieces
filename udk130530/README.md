_making sound from light with an Arduino (analog inputs, smoothing data, 1bit music)_

//--voltage dividers
--------------------
* look at `voltage_divider.png`.
* try to measure the resistance of a potentiometer (pot) and then a photocell (ldr).
* connect 5v and gnd to the outer legs of a pot and measure voltage between the middle leg and gnd.
* if you swap 5v and gnd it does not matter much. It will just flip the direction of the pot.

//--read analog sensors
-----------------------
The analog inputs (6 on a standard arduino) can read voltage (up to 5v).
With the analogRead() method you get a number from 0 to 1023 that matches this voltage reading.

* upload sketch `analogInOut` to your bare bone arduino.
* connect a pot with middle leg to pin 23 (A0 on a real arduino) and left/right legs to 5v and gnd (or gnd and 5v - does not matter)
* make sure you have a resistor and one led connected to the first uln2803 output (pin 20 of the uln2803).
* the led should now be controlled (dimmed) by the potentiometer.

//--read ldr sensor
-------------------
* replace the pot with a ldr + 10k resistor. See `ldr_schem.png`.
* the led should fade according to the voltage on A0.
* try to swap the 5v and gnd connected to the resistor+ldr. What happens?
* try to change the places of the resistor and the ldr. What happens?
* upload `analogInOut_serial` and look at the values in serial monitor.
* calibrate by changing 2nd and 3rd value in map()
* upload `smoothing` and check out how to make sensor readings less noisy.

* extra: try replacing the led with a small dc motor or server motor.

//--connect a speaker
---------------------
* find a speaker and connect it with a 100ohm resistor. see file `speaker_schem.png`.
* upload the `speaker00` sketch and play with the ldr to change the pitch of the sound.
* upload the `speaker01` sketch and change the code.
* upload the `speaker02` sketch, connect a pot and make noise. Try connecting to big speakers via a mixer.

* extra: again try replacing the led with a small dc motor or server motor to make it play along.
